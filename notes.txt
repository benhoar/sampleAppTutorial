Version control for tracking changes in computer files
Coordinates work between multiple developers
Who made what changes and when
Revert back at any time
Local and remote repos

git init // initialize local git repository
git add <file> // add files to index
git status // check status of working tree (what is to be uploaded)
git commit // commit changes in index
git push // push to remote repository
git pull // pull latest changes from remote repository
git clone // clone repository into a new directory (download to local)

git config --global user.name and user.email 'ans' when setting up new repos

files added using git add are not automatically updated, aka if you make a change and hit save, you have to re-add it

git commit -m 'changed all files' upload all files with comment

a .gitignore file can be added to ignore the upload of some files
   /dir_name to exclude a directory

git branch // make branch
git checkout branch // go to branch
branches â€“ allow you to work on the code base without affecting the host base

important to commit changes before switching branches
